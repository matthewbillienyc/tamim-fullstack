/*
A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// NOTE: can use Math.sqrt

const isPerfectSquare = integer => {
    const squareRoot = Math.sqrt(integer);
    // Your code here
}

const testCases = [
    {
        arguments: [
            3
        ],
        expectedResult: false,
    },
    {
        arguments: [
            9
        ],
        expectedResult: true,
    },
    {
        arguments: [
            16
        ],
        expectedResult: true,
    },
    {
        arguments: [
            21
        ],
        expectedResult: false,
    },
];

testCases.forEach(({ arguments, expectedResult }, index) => {
    const result = isPerfectSquare(...arguments);
    if (result === expectedResult) {
        console.log(`TEST CASE ${index + 1} PASSED`)
    } else {
        console.log(`TEST CASE ${index + 1} FAILED, expected result; ${expectedResult} actual result; ${result}`)
    }
});
