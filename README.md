## Tools to install

### XCode
XCode is Apple's developer kit, needed by many libraries.

https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode%208.2

### Homebrew
Homebrew is a framework for installing tools / libraries / languages easily.

https://brew.sh/

### ITerm2
ITerm2 is a better terminal than the out-of-the-box mac terminal

Open ITerm2 and run
`brew install --cask iterm2`

### Git
Git is a version control framework. It allows us to have a complete history of changes to our code, and gives us the ability to revert to previous states in our code.

Open ITerm2 and run
`brew install git`

### Docker
Docker is a framework for running containers (lighter weight virtual machines) that we will use to run almost all applications

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Zsh
Zsh gives you some nice terminal functionality like autocomplete git branches, colorized git info, etc.

Open ITerm2 and run
`brew install zsh`

### NVM
NVM is Node Version Manager, it allows us to easily install / change our node version for running javascript script files. (We will not bother containerizing these, since they are fairly simple so we need Node installed locally (outside docker))

`brew install nvm`

### Node
Node is the javascript engine we will develop in.

`nvm install 16`

### VSCode
VSCode is the code editor we will use. It's awesome and has a ton of great features / plugins

https://code.visualstudio.com/download


## Helpful resources

### Javascript
We should get you started on an intro to javascript course, just to get familiar with the syntax etc.

I think you should be able to access this one for free
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/introduction-to-javascript/

If not we can find another.

### JSON
Javascript Object Notation - how we structure data in JS. 

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp

### Git
Intro to git

https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

Also worth noting, you should 'clone' the repository (this project) onto your computer. Run the following command from the parent directory you want the project to live in. (I would suggest ~/code)
`git clone git@github.com:matthewbillienyc/tamim-fullstack.git`

Then from `~/code` directory, run `cd tamim-fullstack` and `code .` to open the project in VSCode.
